# 🐳 Docker Containers

Welcome to my container hub. Here you will find some services that I use frequently
with **my configurations**, so be aware that maybe you will need to configure
something by yourself.

## Index

- [DBGate](/dbgate/README.md)
- [Mailpit](/mailpit/README.md)
- [MySQL 5.7](/mysql57/README.md)
- [MySQL 8.4](/mysql8/README.md)
- [PostgreSQL](/postgres/README.md)

## Requirements

- Docker (🤷🏻‍)
- Docker Compose (_optional_)

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. On each container, build and run it

   > [!INFO]
   > Or simply run `docker compose up -d`

   > [!WARNING]
   > Some containers requires a Docker subnet.  
   > Be sure that you read container's README.

3. Read the `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` from each container
   to know more about it. Feel free to edit as you wish.
